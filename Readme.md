# ezyVet Developers Practical Task Brief

## To run the code

- from the root dir
  `php -S localhost:3000`
- open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

## Objective:

- Write a simple PHP Class for a basic shopping cart.

## Supplied:

- Products in an array (these do not require any editing).

## Requirements:

- The cart will need to keep its “state” during page loads / refreshes
- List Products – these should be listed at all times to allow adding of products
- Products should be listed in this format: product name, price, link to add product
- Must be able to add a product to the cart
- Must be able to view current products in the cart
- Cart products should be listed in this format: product name, price, quantity, total, remove link
- Product totals should be tallied to give an overall total
- Must be able to remove a product from the cart
- Adding an existing product will only update existing cart product quantity (e.g. adding the same product twice will NOT create two cart items)
- All prices should be displayed to 2 decimal places
- Error checking will be set to strict for viewing completed code
- Project will work as expected in PHP 7.0+
  This task should take 1-2 hours max. HTML look will not be a consideration when viewing the finished code.

## Product List:

```
<?php
// ######## please do not alter the following code ########
$products = [
  [ "name" => "Sledgehammer", "price" => 125.75 ],
  [ "name" => "Axe", "price" => 190.50 ],
  [ "name" => "Bandsaw", "price" => 562.131 ],
  [ "name" => "Chisel", "price" => 12.9 ],
  [ "name" => "Hacksaw", "price" => 18.45 ],
  ];
